# wait-watchers

## Description

Wait-Watchers is calorie and intake tracking app.

- What motivated the project was Josh's ever expanding waistline and his fervent desire to change his eating habits.
- We built an application that would allow us to more easily not track our intake but aldo give us an idea of an appropriate amount of intake.
- What did we learn? We learned that authentification can be difficult and tying the front end to the backend is complex. We also learned that we should deploy our projects early and not wait till the last minute.
